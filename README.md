The <strong>Gender Equality 2020</strong> dashboard summarizes the gender equality index published by the WBL 2020 in its annual report. The Woman, Business, and the Law (World Bank Group) tracks where laws facilitate or limit the women’s economic participation in 190 countries. The data is composed of 8 indicators that measure legal differences between men and women as they transition through different stages of working life. The indicators are <strong> Mobility, Workplace, Pay, Marriage, Parenthood, Entrepreneurship, Assets, Pension.</strong>

 

The first part of the dashboard provides a global overview of the gender equality index in 2020. The first chart, <strong>“How equal is the world in 2020?”</strong>, shows the gender equality index by economy. Navigate through the <strong> “The WBL Index by Country”</strong> to check the index by country. To refine your search, use the filter and select a country to update all views available in the dashboard. Finally, in the chart <strong> “Exploring the 8 indicators that compose the WBL Index”</strong>, check the values of each indicator. The indicator gives a glimpse of which field the country is lacking and needs to improve to achieve gender equality.

 

Finally, the second part of the dashboard, <strong>“How much have we evolved over the past 50 years?”</strong> shows the evolution over the past 50 years by each of the indicators.
